//Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.
//Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:
//If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.
//Example
//[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]
//Notes
//The input array will always contain only positive numbers, and will never be empty or null.
