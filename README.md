## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

The first thing I do everyday is solve a codewars. Depending on my schedule I solve anywhere from one to three problems, five days a week.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code as I learn new ways to solve problems.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned is understanding it's okay to not know how to solve a problem. The most important thing to do is to look at the solution and spend just as much time, if not more, in understanding how it is done to better prepare for future challenges.
